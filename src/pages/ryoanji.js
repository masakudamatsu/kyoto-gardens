          Pick any travel guide for Kyoto. I'm sure you’ll find Ryoan-ji, a Zen
          Buddhist temple famous for its Rock Garden (pictured above).

          This zen garden is made of fifteen rocks, surrounded by patches of
          moss, laid out in the ocean of gravels on a walled rectangular plot.

          If you have been to this garden, you must have been utterly puzzled
          during your visit. Too abstract and too minimal. I also scratched my
          head during my first visit to the garden. My second visit a year later
          didn’t help me figure out anything, either.

          During the third visit, however, the whole garden started to make
          sense to me. It taught me how to live a happy life, with the layout of
          the fifteen rocks as the “textbook”.

          The key to understand this cryptic garden is to see it from where
          you're supposed to: halfway between the left and right edges of this
          rectangular garden, indicated with the gray arrow in the floor plan
          below:

          My third visit to the garden was different from the previous ones in
          that I had this piece of knowledge, learned from a book on Japanese
          gardens (

          be seen from this viewpoint.
