            Pick any travel guide for Kyoto. I'm sure you’ll find Ryoan-ji, a
            Zen Buddhist temple famous for its Rock Garden (pictured above).

            This zen garden is made of fifteen rocks, surrounded by patches of
            moss, laid out in the ocean of gravels on a walled rectangular plot.
          </P>

          <P>
            If you have been to this garden, you must have been utterly puzzled
            during your visit. Too abstract and too minimal. I also scratched my
            head during my first visit to the garden. My second visit a year
            later didn’t help me figure out anything, either.
          </P>
          <Spacer betweenParagraphs textOnly />
          <P>
            During the third visit, however, the whole garden started to make
            sense to me. It taught me how to live a happy life, with the layout
            of the fifteen rocks as the “textbook”.

            The key to understand this cryptic garden is to see it from where

            rectangular garden, indicated with the gray arrow in the floor plan

            My third visit to the garden was different from the previous ones in
            that I had this piece of knowledge, learned from a book on Japanese
            gardens (

            , pp. 58-59). The book says that the whole garden was constructed to
            be seen from this viewpoint.

              Finally, I turn my head to the right while still staying at the
              same viewpoint. There are three groups of rocks, but none of them
              stand out clearly. Location in the middle usually casts the
              spotlight, but the two rocks in the middle group look rather
              modest and are located off the center. Nothing is stressed in this
              view, either.

            The lack of emphasis, I then notice, penetrates into how fifteen
            rocks are arranged into five clusters, each surrounded by a patch of

              The middle-left cluster consists of two rocks. There is no center.

              magnificent composition in this garden if seen from the front of
              it. One large, well-shaped rock stands in the middle, flanked by
              two small standing rocks and two flat stones farther away. But the
              whole group is marginalized at the left edge of the garden, not at
              the center. When seen from the viewpoint, the symmetric

            Now it is clear that nothing is emphasized throughout this garden. I
            start wondering why. The designer of this garden, who remains
            anonymous despite many attempts of historians to identify, must have
            had a purpose. What message did he or she try to convey to the
            visitors of this garden?

          <P>
            I remember that each rock in a zen garden is often interpreted as an
            unfulfilled desire in our mind. Once I see the rocks in Ryoan-ji
            Rock Garden as my own unfulfilled desires, the walled rectangular
            garden space begins to look like a metaphor of my inner self.

          <Spacer betweenParagraphs textOnly />
          <P>
            No emphasis on any of the fifteen rocks, I conclude, can therefore
            be interpreted as the following message:

            This idea is central to the preaching of Zen Buddhism to live a
            happy life. Don’t keep regretting what you’ve done in the past.
            Don’t always be worried about your uncertain future. Nothing should
            be at the center of your mind, just like the arrangement of these
            fifteen rocks within the walled rectangular plot.

            Ever since I managed to interpret the meaning of Ryoan-ji Rock
            Garden as described above, I've been paying a visit to this zen
            garden whenever I get too much preoccupied with my unfulfilled
            desires.

            The best way to appreciate the garden is to arrive early in the
            morning before tourists start flocking to Ryoan-ji Temple. I arrive
            there when the temple opens its gate at 8am (or at 8:30am from
            December to February). I sit down at the viewpoint explained above.
            Then I observe how the rising sun constantly changes its way of
            illuminating the garden as the time passes by—no fixation on a
            particular moment.

            By 10am, a flock of tourists start arriving and counting how many
            rocks there are—which is totally off the point about this garden. I
            leave the rock garden and take a stroll around the pond garden
            outside, which I realize also avoids creating any focal point.

            With the 21st century's life overloaded with information, it is so
            easy to forget the simple principle of happiness that the Buddha
            discovered in the 5th century BC. With its minimal, yet profound
            composition of 15 rocks, Ryoan-ji Rock Garden has been there since
            the early 16th century to reminds us of the teaching of the Buddha.
