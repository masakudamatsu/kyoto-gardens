              you’ll find Ryoan-ji, a Zen Buddhist temple famous for its Rock
              Garden (pictured above).
            </P>
            <P belowTextParagraph>
              This zen garden is made of fifteen rocks, surrounded by patches of
              moss, laid out in the ocean of gravels on a walled rectangular
              plot.
            </P>
            <P belowTextParagraph>And that’s it…</P>
            <P belowTextParagraph>
              If you have been to this garden, you must have been utterly
              puzzled during your visit. Too abstract and too minimal. I also
              scratched my head during my first visit to the garden. My second
              visit a year later didn’t help me figure out anything, either.
            </P>
            <P belowTextParagraph>
              During the third visit, however, the whole garden started to make
              sense to me. It taught me how to live a happy life, with the
              layout of the fifteen rocks as the “textbook”.

              The key to understand this cryptic garden is to see it from where
              You’re supposed to: halfway between the left and right edges of
              this rectangular garden, indicated with the gray arrow in the

              My third visit to the garden was different from the previous ones
              in that I had this piece of knowledge, learned from a book on
              Japanese gardens (
              <Link

              , pp. 58-59). The book says that the whole garden was constructed
              to be seen from this viewpoint.

            <P belowBoxParagraph>
              Once I sit down and see the garden from the correct viewpoint, the
              layout of fifteen rocks starts taking on its meaning:{' '}

                There is no stone at the center of gaze when I look straight
                ahead. The landscape composition is split between two groups of
                rocks on the right and on the left. Nothing is really
                emphasized.

                Next, I turn my head to the left while sitting in the same
                viewpoint. There is again nothing in the center of my vision.
                The view is split. Nothing is emphasised.

                Finally, I turn my head to the right while still staying at the
                same viewpoint. There are three groups of rocks, but none of
                them stand out clearly. Location in the middle usually casts the
                spotlight, but the two rocks in the middle group look rather
                modest and are located off the center. Nothing is stressed in
                this view, either.

              The lack of emphasis, I then notice, penetrates into how fifteen
              rocks are arranged into five clusters, each surrounded by a patch
              of moss. Let’s start looking at the middle three clusters.

                disappears from sight when seen from the viewpoint, as it hides

            <P belowBoxParagraph>
              Now it is clear that nothing is emphasized throughout this garden.
              I start wondering why. The designer of this garden, who remains
              anonymous despite many attempts of historians to identify, must
              have had a purpose. What message did he or she try to convey to
              the visitors of this garden?
            </P>
            <P belowTextParagraph>
              I remember that each rock in a zen garden is often interpreted as
              an unfulfilled desire in our mind. Once I see the rocks in
              Ryoan-ji Rock Garden as my own unfulfilled desires, the walled
              rectangular garden space begins to look like a metaphor of my
              inner self.
            </P>
            <P belowTextParagraph>
              No emphasis on any of the fifteen rocks, I conclude, can therefore
              be interpreted as the following message:
            </P>
            <P belowTextParagraph message>
              <Italic>
                Don’t fixate on <Span nowrap>one particular thing</Span>{' '}

            <P belowTextParagraph>
              This idea is central to the preaching of Zen Buddhism to live a
              happy life. Don’t keep regretting what you’ve done in the past.
              Don’t always be worried about your uncertain future. Nothing
              should be at the center of your mind, just like the arrangement of
              these fifteen rocks within the walled rectangular plot.

            <P belowBoxParagraph>
              Ever since I managed to interpret the meaning of Ryoan-ji Rock
              Garden as described above, I’ve been paying a visit to this zen
              garden whenever I get too much preoccupied with my unfulfilled
              desires.
            </P>
            <P belowTextParagraph>
              The best way to appreciate the garden is to arrive early in the
              morning before tourists start flocking to Ryoan-ji Temple. I
              arrive there when the temple opens its gate at 8<Abbr>am</Abbr>{' '}
              (or at 8:30
              <Abbr>am</Abbr> from December to February). I sit down at the
              viewpoint explained above. Then I observe how the rising sun
              constantly changes its way of illuminating the garden as the time
              passes by—no fixation on a particular moment.
            </P>
            <P belowTextParagraph>
              By 10<Abbr>am</Abbr>, a flock of tourists start arriving and
              counting how many rocks there are—which is totally off the point
              about this garden. I leave the rock garden and take a stroll
              around the pond garden outside, which I realize also avoids
              creating any focal point.

              With the 21st century’s life overloaded with information, it is so
              easy to forget the simple principle of happiness that the Buddha
              discovered in the 5th century <Abbr>BC</Abbr>. With its minimal,
              yet profound composition of 15 rocks, Ryoan-ji Rock Garden has
              been there since the early 16th century to reminds us of the
              teaching of the Buddha.
