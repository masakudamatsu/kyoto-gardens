## CSS code management

### Principles

#### Separate css declarations by purpose

If we need the list of all declarations for a selector, see snapshot tests (or Chrome DevTools)

#### Purposes of css declarations

  1. Font style

      This includes `color` and `background-color`, both of which are essential for the legibility of letters. They are also one of the means to make headings stand out (just like `font-family` and `font-weight` do)
  
  2. Side margin/padding
  3. Vertical margin/padding beyond `line-height`

### How each CSS property value is derived
